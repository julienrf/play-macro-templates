  <p>We can do better than just dynamically resolving the template of a page: we can also generate a navigation menu from the list of pages. A basic menu could be generated by iterating over the page map keys:</p>

  <pre><code>@@for(path <- pages.keys) {
    &lt;a href="@@routes.Application.page(path)"&gt;path&lt;/a&gt;
}</code></pre>

    <p>However, that would be better to show a nice page title in the link text, rather than the page path. We can solve this problem by using the application’s i18n messages:</p>

    <pre><code>@@for(path <- pages.key) {
  &lt;a href="@@routes.Application.page(path)"&gt;@@Messages(s"$path.title")&lt;/a&gt;
}</code></pre>

    <p>Then in our <code>conf/messages</code> file we can define the title of each page:</p>

    <pre><code>foo.title=Foo’s page title</code></pre>

    <p>Actually, there is yet another problem with this menu generation system: we can not control the order of the pages in the menu. We can solve it by using a kind of naming convention for the pages. For instance, in this Web site example, page names that are prefixed by <code>_pos_</code>, where <code>pos</code> is a number, are displayed in the menu and sorted by their <code>pos</code> value. For a blog you could use another convention, based on a format similar to a date, <em>e.g.</em> <code>_yyyy.mm.dd_</code>, to sort your articles by date.</p>
